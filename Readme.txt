The research question in this project was:

The files here are created in 2019. The following folder contains the final version of this project.
ChucK codes/July/Final Test
You should use those sound, and adding the referential sound in the CHUCK decoder.
NOTE THAT the web chuck doesn't support this. You will have to use the software version to add multiple sound tracks and play them at the same time.
