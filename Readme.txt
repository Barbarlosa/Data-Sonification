The research question is 

Can adding a referential sound help improve people's accuracy when perceiving time when listen to the sound. In this project, time is used to represent X-axis, or the independent variable. 

You should use those sound, and adding the referential sound in the CHUCK decoder.

NOTE THAT the web chuck doesn't support this. You will have to use the software version to add multiple sound tracks and play them at the same time.
